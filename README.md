- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Magnus LyckÃ¥, @magnus-lycka on Github.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a curious person with lots of interests, and I always have a few projects in the air.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning new things about technology, humanity and this world that we live in.
  I've been fond of [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/) since 1.2.8, and [Python](https://www.python.org/) since 1.4.2.
  I've worked with databases and SQL since 1990.
  I've had a passion for agile ways of working since I came across 
  [Extreme Programming](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgramming) and
  [Refactoring](https://refactoring.com/) in 1999.
  Lately, I've spent time helping teams get better at things like 
  [Continuous Delivery](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html),
  [Immutable Infrastructure](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-mutable-vs-immutable-infrastructure)
  and using the [cloud](https://landscape.cncf.io/).
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lycka).
